## About

Here we have a small Angular 5 SPA, which enables you to simply track the time for any task you're currently working on.

## Features

1. Table with tracking entries
2. Timer, which can is working in both direction (counting down or up)

## How to continue with this Project

All you have to do is the following:

1. Clone the Repository to the desired location on your computer
2. Open a terminal (eg. Powershell) in the repositories directory and type "npm install"
3. To work and test the application, type "npm run ng serve" or "npm run ng test".
    - With the first command you will get a localhost URL, which you can open up in your browser (somewhat like http://localhost:4200/Time-Measurement-Angular/dist)
